nmrstarlib.bmrblex
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This module provides :func:`~nmrstarlib.bmrblex.bmrblex` lexical analyzer for
BMRB NMR-STAR format syntax. It is implemented as Python generator-based
state machine which generates (yields) token one at a time when
:py:func:`next()` is invoked on :func:`~nmrstarlib.bmrblex.bmrblex` instance.


Simplified description of parsing rules:
----------------------------------------
   * Each word or number separated by whitespace characters is a separate BMRB token.
   * Each single quoted (') string is a separate BMRB token, it should start with a single quote (')
     and end with a single quote *always* followed by whitespace character(s).
   * Each double quoted (") string is a separate BMRB token, it should start with a double quote (")
     and end with a double quote *always* followed by whitespace character(s).
   * Single quoted and double quoted strings have to be processed separately.
   * Single quoted and double quoted strings are processed one character at a time.
   * Multiline strings start with a semicolon *always* followed by new line character and
     ending with a semicolon *always* followed by whitespace character(s).
   * Multiline strings are processed one line at a time.

.. note::
   * For a full description of NMR-STAR file format, see official documentation:
     http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu/dictionary/
   * For a concise description of the NMR-STAR file format grammar see:
