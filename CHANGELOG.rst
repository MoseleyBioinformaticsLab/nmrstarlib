~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**New features**

- Added support to read CIF formatted files used by Protein Data Bank (PDB).

**Improvements**
- Updated API documentation.
- Updated Tutorial documentation to include access data from CIF formatted files.
- Additional unit tests for CIF formatted files.


2.0.6 (2017-11-08)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Improvements**

- Converted `Tutorial` from regular rst file to jupyter notebook file.
- Updated API documentation.

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed bug for '--seed' option converting `None` to `int`.


2.0.5 (2017-10-27)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed bug for files that does not end with '\n'.
- Cleaned up file printing functionality.


2.0.4 (2017-10-26)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**New features**

- Added seed optional parameter to keep simulated peak lists reproducible from run to run.

**Improvements**
- Exposed `read_files` method at the `nmrstarlib` package-level.
- Improved cli option names.
- Additional unit tests.


2.0.3 (2017-08-03)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**New features**

- Added additional statistical distributions that can be used to generate per-dimension
  noise values during peak list simulations (if numpy is installed additional statistical
  distributions can be used).

**Improvements**

- Added code coverage reports with Codecov.

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed issue #2: https://github.com/MoseleyBioinformaticsLab/nmrstarlib/issues/2
- Fixed issue #5: https://github.com/MoseleyBioinformaticsLab/nmrstarlib/issues/5
- Fixed issue #6: https://github.com/MoseleyBioinformaticsLab/nmrstarlib/issues/6


2.0.2 (2017-06-09)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed bug related to sorting of the sequence ids which caused
  problems during sequence sites creation in peak list simulation.
  Sorting is based on integer sequence id value instead of its string
  representation.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed issue #4: https://github.com/MoseleyBioinformaticsLab/nmrstarlib/issues/4
